> (Designing) at the intersection of speculative fiction and anthropology, we find a sense of epistemological humility about the kind of worlds we could or should inhabit. Yet epistemological humility should not be confused with futility: possibilities and potentialities still matter. We do not know what we are capable of, and yet that need not keep us from the pursuit of what ifs.

### INTRODUCTION

**Objective** 

Work in teams to design and build sonic objects that play a critical role in the world you are tasked to explore. These objects should mediate or facilitate newly emerging rituals shaped by the world’s socio-political, environmental, or technological structures. 

The final outcome will be a collective soundscape performance, telling framgments of a world by showcasing how these objects interact and the rituals they enable and support. This performance, akin to a devised play, will not tell a linear story but will instead <ins>present an exploration of critical ideas</ins>.

**Overview**

In a time where design and [ethnography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography) merge to imagine new futures, the creation of objects and systems that mediate interactions across all agents in a network—human to human interactions, human to machine, machine to machine, machine to non-human, and so on—becomes of particular interest. This project is rooted in critical making, a practice that emphasises the interdependence of thinking and making.

[Tim Ingold](https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781136763601_A23879950/preview-9781136763601_A23879950.pdf)’s perspective is particularly relevant here, as it highlights how objects and materials are not just passive tools but active agents in shaping human understanding and behaviour. In this context, your task is to create objects that not only function within imagined rituals but also challenge and critique the systems they inhabit.

These objects will serve as mediators of rituals, which are not limited to traditional or ceremonial practices but extend into everyday, habitual constructs—whether social, ecological, or political. The critical fables embedded within these objects will emerge not from an explicit narrative but from their interaction with the systems they support or subvert. These fables act as a form of critique, inviting us to question how imagined societies might grapple with the issues of our present, such as resource scarcity, technological dependence, or social inequality.

Drawing parallels to [Sun Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra)’s [*Space Is The Place*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Is_the_Place), where music transcends time and space, we approach sound not merely as an aesthetic experience but as a means of inquiry. The sonic objects you create will not just emit sound but will mediate complex systems, engaging with their speculative worlds on a functional and philosophical level. 

Like [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin) and [Todd Barton](https://www.toddbarton.com/)’s [*Music And Poetry Of The Kesh*](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/kesh-music), where instruments are deeply intertwined with the values and lifeways of a fictional society, the objects you design must embody the rituals, values, and tensions of the world they belong to.

The objects you create are not just artefacts; <ins>they are catalysts for thinking.</ins> The boundaries between object, ritual and system, are intentionally blurred, you are crafting critical fables—narratives that offer new ways of understanding the present and imagining alternative paths forward.

### 1. A SYSTEM OF EMERGENT RITUALS

The world you will explore is defined by the emergence of **new rituals** responding to shifting conditions. These rituals may not even be consciously recognised by the inhabitants as "rituals"; rather, they are everyday practices that organise life, from social etiquette to resource management and conflict resolution.

Your task is to design **objects** that facilitate or mediate these emerging rituals. These artefacts should be practical and integral to the functioning of the speculative world’s systems.

**Examples**:
- A **bureaucratic object** designed for identity verification, playing a crucial role in organising the distribution of scarce resources or enforcing social hierarchies.

- An **audio tool** that facilitates communication between inhabitants and their environment, enabling them to navigate, interpret, or even manipulate natural elements for survival.

- A **territorial marker**, a device that emits signals or cues to define invisible borders, regulating who can cross into or out of various territories in a fragmented world, perhaps functioning as a key element in maintaining the power dynamics between neighbouring zones. 

The objects should reflect the **systems** of this world (social, political, or ecological) and be deeply embedded in its **ritualistic practices**.

### 2. Ritual as Everyday Construct

Rituals, in this brief, extend beyond traditional ceremonies and include **any organised, habitual practice** that forms part of the world’s social fabric. These might be daily practices, such as energy harvesting, regular communication across locations, or the management of scarce resources.

Each group is tasked with designing objects that play a pivotal role in these **practical, everyday rituals**. Rather than focusing on metaphorical representations, the object should serve a functional purpose within the world’s structures.

**Examples**:
- A **Conversational Coffee Machine**: The communal office coffee machine begins to offer personalized drink recommendations based on the time of day and previous choices. Over time, it starts sharing quirky trivia or motivational quotes that align uncannily with employees' current projects or moods, subtly influencing the office atmosphere and becoming a central piece in daily interactions.

- A **Serendipity Fare Card**: The public transport fare card not only handles payments but also occasionally grants random rewards—like free rides or discounts at local businesses—based on travel patterns. Commuters start to alter their routes slightly, hoping to trigger these unexpected benefits, which gradually reshapes the flow of people through the city in unpredictable ways.

- An **Empathy Fitness Wristbands**: Beyond tracking physical activity, these wristbands detect and share subtle emotional cues among wearers in close proximity. When someone nearby is stressed, the wristband gently notifies others, encouraging supportive interactions. This leads to a new social ritual where people become more attuned to the well-being of those around them, fostering a more compassionate community.

Your focus is to create objects that **function** within the speculative world’s systems, helping to ground the rituals in a practical, everyday context.

### 3. Sound as Integral to Object Function

In this project, sound should not be a separate, symbolic layer but an **essential part** of how the object operates. The sound produced by the objects could serve functional purposes (e.g., as alarms or feedback mechanisms) or shape the experiential aspects of the ritual itself.

**Examples**:
- A **walking staff** used by travellers that emits sounds responding to the environment. As the user moves, the staff produces gentle tones that vary based on proximity to resources like food, water, or safe shelter. When danger is near—such as unstable terrain or hazardous weather—the sounds shift to urgent, dissonant notes. 

- **Kitchen tools** that emit sounds to indicate cooking stages. For example, a stirring spoon that changes its resonance based on the temperature or consistency of a dish. When the desired state is achieved, the spoon produces a satisfying chime.

The challenge is to ensure that **sound is inseparable from the object’s function**, contributing to the ritual without relying on abstraction or symbolism.

### 4. Critical Fables Embedded in Objects and Rituals

The critical fables will emerge from the **interaction between the designed objects and the systems** they serve. As you design the objects, consider the underlying structures they reinforce or challenge, and what social or political lessons are embedded in their use.

**Questions to Consider**:
- What **systemic issues** (such as power dynamics, surveillance, or resource control) does the object engage with?

- Does the object **solve** a problem, or does it create new ones, exposing vulnerabilities in the system?

**Examples**:
- A **passport control device** might reveal issues of surveillance and freedom of movement, raising questions about who is granted access in this environment.

- A **territorial marker** could expose power imbalances related to the distribution of resources, reflecting how certain groups or areas are marginalised.

The "lesson" of the critical fable comes through **how the object functions in its world**, rather than through explicit storytelling or moralising.

### 5. Collective Soundscape

The final performance will feature a **collective soundscape**, created by the interaction of all the designed objects. Each object’s sound will respond to or affect the sounds of others, creating an emergent, collaborative sound environment. The focus is on how the objects **interact within a shared space**, rather than on separate, linear performances.

**Example**:
- One group’s **audio tool** might emit frequencies that alter another group’s **environmental sensor**.

This collective performance will showcase the **interconnectedness of the systems** through sound, without relying on narrative. The goal is to explore how these rituals and systems function together in real time, as part of a cohesive world.

### 6. BIOME AS CATALYST

The speculative world you will work within is an **adaptive system**, constantly responding to new challenges—whether environmental, technological, or political. Rituals evolve to help inhabitants navigate these shifts, and the objects you design will play a key role in sustaining or disrupting these rituals.

To create meaningful and impactful designs, it's essential that you thoroughly read and engage with the detailed description of this world. Pay close attention to its nuances and complexities, as understanding the environment and its dynamics will inform your object's functionality and relevance within the system.

The challenge is to design objects that both **fit within** this world and **reflect the larger structures** that shape it. A description of the world you are tasked to inhabit can be found here: [**The Alchemy Of Ruin**](TheAlchemyOfRuin.md).

### DELIVERABLES

### SOUND PRODUCTION

Building upon previous iterations of Sound Systems, sound in this project will be produced electronically. You will need to engage in designing, programming, and embedding electronic devices as integral parts of your objects and rituals. We will have support from Felix Loftus and Karsten Goodwin from the Digital and Physical Computing Lab to assist us in our endeavours. This year, we have opted to use the [Seeed XIAO ESP32S3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/) microcontroller to process physical inputs and wirelessly send data to computers and/or phones for sound signal processing in [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max), [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), [Ableton Note](https://www.ableton.com/en/note/), and similar platforms.

Although we have planned for these technologies, electronic sound production isn't limited to them, and you are welcome to explore alternative methods. For instance, [here is a link](https://sitraka-.github.io/Sound-Systems/TEENSY.html) to last year's resources, where they used a Teensy microcontroller as their sound engine.
