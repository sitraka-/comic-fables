> (Designing) at the intersection of speculative fiction and anthropology, we find a sense of epistemological humility about the kind of worlds we could or should inhabit. Yet epistemological humility should not be confused with futility: possibilities and potentialities still matter. We do not know what we are capable of, and yet that need not keep us from the pursuit of what ifs.

### INTRODUCTION

**Objective**: 

Work in teams to design and build sonic objects that play a critical role in the world you are tasked to explore. These objects should mediate or facilitate newly emerging rituals shaped by the world’s socio-political, environmental, or technological structures. 

The final outcome will be a collective soundscape performance, telling framgments of a world by showcasing how these objects interact and the rituals they enable and support. This performance, akin to a devised play, will not tell a linear story but will instead present an exploration of critical ideas.

**Overview**:

In a time where design and ethnography merge to imagine new futures, the creation of objects and systems that mediate interactions across all agents in a network—human to human interactions, human to machine, machine to machine, machine to non-human, and so on—becomes of particular interest. This project is rooted in critical making, a practice that emphasises the interdependence of thinking and making.

[Tim Ingold](https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781136763601_A23879950/preview-9781136763601_A23879950.pdf)’s perspective is particularly relevant here, as it highlights how objects and materials are not just passive tools but active agents in shaping human understanding and behaviour. In this context, your task is to create objects that not only function within imagined rituals but also challenge and critique the systems they inhabit.

These objects will serve as mediators of rituals, which are not limited to traditional or ceremonial practices but extend into everyday, habitual constructs—whether social, ecological, or political. The critical fables embedded within these objects will emerge not from an explicit narrative but from their interaction with the systems they support or subvert. These fables act as a form of critique, inviting us to question how imagined societies might grapple with the issues of our present, such as resource scarcity, technological dependence, or social inequality.

Drawing parallels to [Sun Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra)’s [*Space Is The Place*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Is_the_Place), where music transcends time and space, we approach sound not merely as an aesthetic experience but as a means of inquiry. The sonic objects you create will not just emit sound but will mediate complex systems, engaging with their speculative worlds on a functional and philosophical level. 

Like [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin) and [Todd Barton](https://www.toddbarton.com/)’s [*Music And Poetry Of The Kesh*](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/kesh-music), where instruments are deeply intertwined with the values and lifeways of a fictional society, the objects you design must embody the rituals, values, and tensions of the world they belong to.

The objects you create are not just artefacts; they are catalysts for thinking. The boundaries between maker and object, ritual and system, are intentionally blurred, you are crafting critical fables—narratives that offer new ways of understanding the present and imagining alternative paths forward.

### 1. A SYSTEM OF EMERGENT RITUALS

The world you will explore is not defined by a single crisis or event but by the emergence of **new rituals** responding to shifting conditions. These rituals may not even be consciously recognised by the inhabitants as "rituals"; rather, they are everyday practices that organise life, from social etiquette to resource management.

Your task is to design **objects** that facilitate or mediate these emerging rituals. These artefacts should be practical and integral to the functioning of the speculative world’s systems.

**Examples**:
- A **bureaucratic object** for managing identity verification which could be central to the regulation of people’s access to resources or mobility.
- A **sonic tool** used to interact with the environment, perhaps helping inhabitants communicate with natural elements or harvest resources.
- A **geopolitical device** acting as a border control mechanism in a fragmented world, possibly regulating who can cross into different territories.

The objects should reflect the **systems** of this world (social, political, or ecological) and be deeply embedded in its **ritualistic practices**.

### 2. Ritual as Everyday Construct

Rituals, in this brief, extend beyond traditional ceremonies and include **any organised, habitual practice** that forms part of the world’s social fabric. These might be daily practices, such as energy harvesting, regular communication across locations, or the management of scarce resources.

Each group is tasked with designing objects that play a pivotal role in these **practical, everyday rituals**. Rather than focusing on metaphorical representations, the object should serve a functional purpose within the world’s structures.

**Examples**:
- A **device** that facilitates sonic communications between distant communities as part of a survival or resource-sharing ritual.
- A **tool** used in daily environmental monitoring, with its sound indicating shifts in climate or resource availability.

Your focus is to create objects that **function** within the speculative world’s systems, helping to ground the rituals in a practical, everyday context.

### 3. Sound as Integral to Object Function

In this project, sound should not be a separate, symbolic layer but an **essential part** of how the object operates. The sound produced by the objects could serve functional purposes (e.g., as alarms or feedback mechanisms) or shape the experiential aspects of the ritual itself.

**Examples**:
- A **passport control device** might produce sound waves resonating with specific identity frequencies, allowing or denying passage through borders.
- A **water purification tool** could use sonic frequencies to detect impurities, where different sound patterns signal the purity or contamination level of the water.

The challenge is to ensure that **sound is inseparable from the object’s function**, contributing to the ritual without relying on abstraction or symbolism.

### 4. Critical Fables Embedded in Objects and Rituals

The critical fables will emerge from the **interaction between the designed objects and the systems** they serve. As you design the objects, consider the underlying structures they reinforce or challenge, and what social or political lessons are embedded in their use.

**Questions to Consider**:
- What **systemic issues** (such as power dynamics, surveillance, or resource control) does the object engage with?
- Does the object **solve** a problem, or does it create new ones, exposing vulnerabilities in the system?

**Examples**:
- A **passport control device** might reveal issues of surveillance and freedom of movement, raising questions about who is granted access in this environment.
- A **geopolitical tool** could expose power imbalances related to the distribution of resources, reflecting how certain groups or areas are marginalised.

The "lesson" of the critical fable comes through **how the object functions in its world**, rather than through explicit storytelling or moralising.

### 5. Collective Soundscape

The final performance will feature a **collective soundscape**, created by the interaction of all the designed objects. Each object’s sound will respond to or affect the sounds of others, creating an emergent, collaborative sound environment. The focus is on how the objects **interact within a shared space**, rather than on separate, linear performances.

**Examples**:
- One group’s **sonic tool** might emit frequencies that alter another group’s **environmental sensor**.

This collective performance will showcase the **interconnectedness of the systems** through sound, without relying on narrative. The goal is to explore how these rituals and systems function together in real time, as part of a cohesive world.

### 6. BIOME AS METAPHOR

The speculative world you will work within is an **adaptive system**, constantly responding to new challenges—whether environmental, technological, or political. Rituals evolve to help inhabitants navigate these shifts, and the objects you design will play a key role in sustaining or disrupting these rituals.

The challenge is to design objects that both **fit within** this world and **reflect the larger structures** that shape it. 

### SUMMARY

Your task is to create objects that are integral to the emergent rituals of this speculative world. These objects should not only function practically within the world’s systems but also engage with critical issues embedded in the world’s socio-political, environmental, or technological structures. The final collective performance will offer an immersive experience, where the interactions between objects and their sounds form a dynamic, evolving soundscape that reflects the speculative world as a whole.
